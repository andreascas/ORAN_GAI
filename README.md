# ORAN_GAI
The code in this repository was used to send data through our system and apply upscaling mechanisms.\
The setup also implements other opensource solutions, which will not be delved too far into, but an overview or these are presented.\

## System dependencies
python3.10.15\
opencv-python\
pytorch - 2.1.2\
pytorch-cuda 11.8\
tensorflow 2.17.0\
tensoraudio 2.1.2\
torchvision 0.16.2\
numpy\
pandas - for analysis\
basicsr\
tikzplotlib - for plotting purposes only\

### RAN
We use the [OaI project](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g) for the base station. From this we deploy the 4G code for an eNB. \
For the RIC we apply the [FlexRIC project](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/mosaic5g/flexric), which provides monitoring service models, which are used to observe the channel quality.\

The RIC code must be installed on any computer intending to run the mec.py, as it utilizes SMs during the execution.

### UE
We applied the [srsRAN project](https://github.com/srsran), where we modified part of the UE code to alter its TX power over time.\
These act to transfer data from transmitter and receiver of the data is forward through the RAN.


### CN
We applied the [Open5gs project](https://github.com/open5gs), but any CN should work if connected to the eNB correctly.\
Version is not so relevant, as it simply acts as a gateway and endpoint for the RAN to allow the UEs to connect with the outside world.


## code

### mec.py
This script is run on the MEC with a GPU. Most of the dependencies listed were for running this script.\

Its purpose in the setup is to receive the video frames from UE1, and forward these p√• UE2. This also means the MEC computer must be routable for the UEs.\
It has an xApp functionality integrated which monitors the SNR of UE1, and commands it when to compress and when not to compress data.\

The required python bindings files to run xApps, xapp_sdk.py and _xapp_sdk.so must be moved to the util folder after building the flexric project.\

When applying GAI, it was run with the command:\
`$ python3 mec.py -li <mec_ip> -ue2 <ue2_ip> -ue1 <ue1_ip>  -p <port>`
 

When applying the traditional scaling we run it as:\
`$ python3 mec.py -li <mec_ip>  -ue2 <ue2_ip> -ue1 <ue1_ip> -lf nogai  -p <port>`


### ue1.py

This script was run on UE1 with the task of reading video frames, and sending these to the MEC.\
A control channel also exsist between UE1 and the MEC. According to the messages UE1 changes how it sends video frames meant for UE2.\

An aggregate video was made of all the subvideos mentioned from the article [Malicious or Benign? Towards Effective Content Moderation for Children's Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15551).\
This is the video sent through the system.


When applying GAI\
`$ python3 ue1.py -li <ue1_ip>  -mec <mec_ip>  -p <port>`

When not applying GAI\
`$ python3 ue1.py -li <ue1_ip>  -mec <mec_ip>  -g 1 -p  <port>`



### ue2.py
This script has the purpose of receiving VR frames and saving these by writing to a file.\
When not applying GAI, upscaling was done before writing.\

When applying GAI\
`$ python3 ue2.py -li <ue2_ip> -mec <mec_ip> -p <port>`


When not applying GAI\
`$ python3 ue2.py -li <ue2_ip>  -mec <mec_ip>  -p <port>`

### analysis.py

in the file the parameter experiment_folders must be set, which can contain the relative path to the experiment folders.\
These folders are the resulting folder after running mec.py, which collects experiment folders from ue1 and ue2 after the experiments are run.
